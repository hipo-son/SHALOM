SHALOM: System of Hierarchical Agents for Logical Orchestration of Materials
=============================================================================

**SHALOM** is an autonomous multi-agent framework for computational materials science.
Independent agents with distinct roles interact with each other and external environments
(HPC clusters, DFT solvers) to autonomously plan, execute, and evaluate complex
materials discovery workflows.
